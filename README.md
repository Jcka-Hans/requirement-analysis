# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the documentation and resources for **Requirement Analysis** in the context of Software Development. It aims to explore the various methodologies, tools, and best practices for gathering and analyzing software requirements, ensuring that the final product aligns with user needs and business objectives.

The purpose of this repository is to provide insights, examples, and practical knowledge for anyone involved in software development, from business analysts to software engineers.

- ## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where stakeholdersâ€”clients, users, and developersâ€”collaborate to gather, analyze, and define the exact requirements of a software product.

It ensures that everyone understands what the system should do and under what conditions it should operate. This prevents costly misunderstandings and helps the development team build the right product.

### Key Aspects:
- **Functional Requirements** â€“ What the system should do (e.g., login, data processing).
- **Non-Functional Requirements** â€“ How the system should perform (e.g., speed, usability).
- **Stakeholder Requirements** â€“ What each user or team expects from the product.
- **Business Requirements** â€“ The business goals and value driving the project.

### Why Itâ€™s Important:
- Forms the **foundation** for design, development, and testing.
- Reduces **rework** by clarifying needs early.
- Enhances **team communication**.
- Aids in **resource and time estimation**.
- Helps deliver a **successful and usable product**.

In short, requirement analysis is the blueprint of your softwareâ€”it tells you *what to build* before you start building.
## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are categorized to ensure that every aspect of the system is properly captured and addressed. The main types include:

### 1. Functional Requirements  
These describe **what the system should do**. They define the core functions and features of the softwareâ€”such as processing data, user authentication, or generating reports.  
ðŸ“Œ *Example: The system shall allow users to reset their password via email.*

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements  
These describe **how the system should perform** rather than what it should do. They cover performance, usability, security, reliability, and scalability.  
ðŸ“Œ *Example: The system should be able to handle 1,000 concurrent users without crashing.*

### 3. Business Requirements  
These are **high-level goals** of the organization or client. They reflect the broader business objectives that the software is meant to support.  
ðŸ“Œ *Example: Improve online customer retention by 20% within six months of product launch.*

### 4. Technical Requirements  
These specify the **technical aspects and constraints** such as the technology stack, integration with other systems, or database structures.  
ðŸ“Œ *Example: The application must use PostgreSQL for data storage.*

By identifying and organizing these requirement types, developers and stakeholders gain a **comprehensive understanding** of what the software must deliver
