- ## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** where stakeholders—clients, users, and developers—collaborate to gather, analyze, and define the exact requirements of a software product.

It ensures that everyone understands what the system should do and under what conditions it should operate. This prevents costly misunderstandings and helps the development team build the right product.

### Key Aspects:
- **Functional Requirements** – What the system should do (e.g., login, data processing).
- **Non-Functional Requirements** – How the system should perform (e.g., speed, usability).
- **Stakeholder Requirements** – What each user or team expects from the product.
- **Business Requirements** – The business goals and value driving the project.

### Why It’s Important:
- Forms the **foundation** for design, development, and testing.
- Reduces **rework** by clarifying needs early.
- Enhances **team communication**.
- Aids in **resource and time estimation**.
- Helps deliver a **successful and usable product**.
